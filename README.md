## Why FrankensteinCore?
* 14.06.2024 test phase ended, release up to lvl 60 next phase, tba.
* OpenSource

The goal of the project is to reproduce the World of Warcraft© game world in a mostly Blizzlike way and as similar as possible to the official game,
but with improvments such as balancing and better low level scaling.

We have joined with a support team to mange the server, the support team and dev team are two different groups.
