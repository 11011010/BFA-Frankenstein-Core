# FrankenCore 



## Why FrankenCore?
* A "playable" server is online ( 07.04.2024 only open for testers ).
* OpenSource
* Everybody can participate
* Hopefully Most complete Bfa source

The goal of the project is to reproduce the World of Warcraft© game world in a mostly Blizzlike way and as similar as possible to the official game,
but with improvments such as balancing and low level scaling.

We have joined with a support team to mange the server, the support team and dev team are two different groups.
